# REST microservice that list the languages used by the 100 trending public repos on GitHub

For every language, you need to calculate the attributes below ðŸ‘‡:

    Number of repos using this language
    The list of repos using the language

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.example.backendcodingchallenge.BackendCodingChallengeApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
